PinnedURL provides a free url shortening service.  This Wordpress Plugin uses the PinnedURL link shortening service.  On a Wordpress blog post action, the plugin captures the Permalink of the post and sends it to the PinnedURL service.  Once the Permalink is shortened by the service, the service updates the original post with the shortened url by appending it to the bottom of the original post.
